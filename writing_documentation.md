Developed programs should be documented at multiple levels, from code comments, through API documentation, to installation and usage documentation.
Comments at each level should take into account different target audience, from experienced developers, to end users with no programming skills.

## Code comments
Code comments, can be block comments or inline comments. They are used to explain what is the piece of code doing. Those should explain why something is done in the domain language and not programming language - why instead of what.

## API documention
API documentation should explain function arguments and outputs, or the object methods. How they are formulated will depend on the laguage.

### Python
Python uses **Docstrings** for function level documentation. You can read detail description of docstring usage in [PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/).

#### autogenerating the documentation
It is possible to automatically generate documentation from docstrings with [pydoc](https://docs.python.org/2/library/pydoc.html) or [sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org).

### R

#### function documentation
Read [Documentation](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/man.html) chapter of Hadleys [R packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz) book for details about docuemnting R code.

Customary R uses `.Rd` files in `/man` directory for documentation. Function level comments starting with `#'` are recognised by `roxygen` and are used to automatically generate .Rd files. Read more about `roxygen` syntax on it's [github page](https://github.com/yihui/roxygen2). `roxygen` will also populage `NAMESPACE` file which is necessary to manage package level imports.

### package documentation
Packages should be documented in a `vignette`. Read more about vignettes in [Package documentation](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/vignettes.html) chapter of Hadleys [R packages](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz) book.

## usage documentation

Every project should have a README file, describing, what is it's functionality and how to start using it.

The detailed end user targeted documentation can be for example done with github wiki or github pages.

Adding screencast describing some use cases can be very helpfull. See [[Making Videos]] for some tips how to make a screencast.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to create webpages, wikis and user documentation with a minimum of effort. Documentation written in markdown looks exactly like a plain-text document and is perfectly human-readable. In addition, it can also be automatically converted to HTML, latex, pdf, etc.
More information about markdown can be found here:

<http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown>

Markdown is used extensively by github. For example, this wiki is written in markdown, as are the small 'information sections' you find at the bottom of most github projects. See for example (scroll to bottom):

<https://github.com/jmaassen/eSalsa-Tools>

To add information to your github project, simply add a 'README.md' file in the root directory of your project and fill it with markdown formatted text explaining what you project is about. Once you are done,
commit the 'README.md' using 'git commit', and push it to github using 'git push'. The information will then automatically appear on your github project page.

Retext is a markdown aware text editor, that can be used to edit markdown files and convert them into HTML or PDF. It can be found at:

<http://sourceforge.net/projects/retext/>

or intalled on Ubuntu linux using:

    sudo apt-get install retext

Alternatively, 'pandoc' is a command line utility that can convert markdown documents to into several other formats (including latex):

<http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/>

To install pandoc on Ubuntu linux (or one of its derivatives) do the following:

    sudo apt-get install pandoc

To convert a MarkDown file to Wikipedia format, use this command:

    pandoc the-markdown-file.md -t mediawiki -o the-output-file.txt


In addition, install 'pdflatex' if you haven't done so already:

    sudo apt-get install tex-live-latex-extra

Now you can simply convert a markdown file to pdf using the following command:

    pandoc -o out.pdf in.md

An Eclipse plugin for previewing the HTML generated by markdown is available on this page:
