# Choosing Languages and Libraries

At NLeSC we prefer Java and Python over C++ and Perl, as these languages in general produce more sustainable code. It is not always possible to choose which libraries we use, as almost all projects have existing code as a starting point.

## Preferred Languages

(In alphabetical order)

- Java
- JavaScript (preferably Typescript)
- Python
- R
